# The block to write into the project's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`

Step 6 of `SKILL.md`. Copy the block below verbatim, with `<!-- STACK LINE -->`
replaced from the table underneath. If the project already has a *CodeLead
preview contract* section, update that one instead of appending a second.

## CodeLead preview contract

This repository is developed with CodeLead. Tasks run in a git worktree and
the Review tab previews this app's dev server, so a few things have to keep
working. Check them before touching dev config, the server entrypoint, or how
URLs and assets are emitted.

CodeLead exports three variables into the preview command and into every
terminal session. All three are absent in ordinary local dev, so each rule
below must be a no-op when they are unset:

- `PREVIEW_PORT` — the port to listen on. **Bind it; never hardcode a port.**
  Fall back to this project's usual port when unset.
- `PREVIEW_BASE_PATH` — the path prefix this app is served under, e.g.
  `/preview/42`, with **no trailing slash**; empty when the app owns its own
  origin. **Honor it:** <!-- STACK LINE -->
- `PREVIEW_ORIGIN` — the browser-facing origin the preview is reached at.

The rest holds whether or not those variables are set:

- **Bind `0.0.0.0`, not `127.0.0.1`.** When the task runs in a container the
  preview reaches this app over the container network, and a socket bound to
  the container's own loopback is invisible to it.

- **Never write a root-absolute URL by hand.** The preview proxy never
  rewrites response bodies, so `href="/"`, `src="/assets/…"`, `url("/fonts/…")`
  in CSS, `fetch("/api/…")` and hardcoded websocket paths escape the prefix and
  hit CodeLead instead of this app. Use the router's own path helper; make CSS
  urls relative to where the *bundle* lands. A hardcoded socket path is the
  worst case — it makes the preview reload itself in a loop.

- **The dev server must be a single process.** Dependency installs, database
  setup and seeds belong in `.devcontainer` lifecycle hooks
  (`postCreateCommand` / `postStartCommand`), never chained onto the start
  command with `&&`.

- **Keep toolchain state out of `$HOME`.** CodeLead overrides `HOME` per task,
  so anything installed under `~` (nvm, rustup, pyenv, cargo, hex) is invisible
  to agents — point those at `/opt/…` in the devcontainer image instead. Build
  output belongs off the shared workspace mount for the same class of reason.

## Stack lines

Replace `<!-- STACK LINE -->` with the row for your stack. These are the same
recipes as [`docs/configuration.md`](https://github.com/emischorr/codelead/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#preview-base-path),
which stays authoritative.

| Stack | Line to paste |
|---|---|
| Vite | it rides in the CodeLead-side preview command as `--base "$PREVIEW_BASE_PATH/"`, so leave this repo's own config alone. |
| Next.js | set `basePath: process.env.PREVIEW_BASE_PATH ?? ""` in `next.config`. |
| Phoenix | set `url: [path: System.get_env("PREVIEW_BASE_PATH", "/")]` on the endpoint in `config/dev.exs`. |
| Rails | set `config.relative_url_root = ENV["PREVIEW_BASE_PATH"]`. |
| Django | set `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME = os.environ.get("PREVIEW_BASE_PATH") or None` and derive `STATIC_URL` from it. |
| Static files | nothing to do — serve the directory and keep every asset path relative. |

And the flag that binds every interface, if your start command needs one
spelled out:

| Stack | Flag |
|---|---|
| Phoenix | `http: [ip: {0, 0, 0, 0}]` |
| Vite | `--host` |
| Next.js | `-H 0.0.0.0` |
| Rails | `-b 0.0.0.0` |
| Django | `runserver 0.0.0.0:$PREVIEW_PORT` |
